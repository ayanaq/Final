question 1: 
Git Switch and Git Checkout are both used for switching between different branches in a repository. However, Git Checkout is a versatile command also capable of discarding changes and creating new branches, while Git Switch is a newer, more specialized command focused solely on switching and creating branches.

question 2:
Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch. Note that all of the commands presented below merge into the current branch.

To see all remote branch names, run git branch -r:
To see all local and remote branches, run git branch -a:
